ICM_curriculum_plan_track

# 🏥 Aims

NHS ePortfolio is useful but not to customisable, as far as I'm aware there's no API or way to build extensions for it. How are you supposed to procrastinate whilst telling yourself you're making progress? Luckily for me, I've found a really effective way to waste my limited time.

This project will currently log into your NHS ICM eportfolio for you. It will load up the curriculum and download it, as well as whether you've had it marked off as completed or not. It will also do the same for the Top 30 cases.

After doing that it will compile a report for you, showing what still needs to get done.

My hope is that this will serve as a source of pressure for me to keep on track of everything.
